# Env-OpenClock
 A fancy lil clock using 8x LTP-305s and a Raspberry Pi Pico.


## Information
This clock features a DS3231 but it doesnt have its own onboard battery management meaning its meant to have constant power but there is nothing stopping anyone from soldering something like a pico lipo shim to the back of the PCB. The RTC is mainly for convenience.

There are 4 buttons and a switch, The switch is meant for Summer time adjustment and the 4 buttons are for setting the time or alarm.
